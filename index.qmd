# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the Surface Water Ambient Monitoring Program ([SWAMP](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/)) Strategy!

This is an online reference and resource written by the California State Water Resources Control Board ([State Water Board](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/)) SWAMP Team. The SWAMP Team is composed of multiple team members at the State Water Board within the SWAMP Unit, SWAMP Information Management and Quality Assurance Center ([SWAMP IQ](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/swamp_iq/)), and others in the Office of Information Management and Analysis ([OIMA](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/resources/oima/)).

Content in this SWAMP Strategy includes strategic and tactical planning documentation for SWAMP's Science and Data Communication projects and Statewide Programs (e.g., [Bioaccumulation](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/bioaccumulation_monitoring.html), [Bioassessment](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/bioassessment/), [Freshwater Harmful Algal Blooms](https://mywaterquality.ca.gov/habs/index.html), and [Toxicity and Contaminants](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/spot/)), including:

-   **About Pages** - provide brief background to Program or Project, including a description of core principles and programmatic drivers, and a list of key contacts (e.g. [About SWAMP](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/swamp-strategy/about-swamp.html))
