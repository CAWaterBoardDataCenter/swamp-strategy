The objective of the PFAS Archive Project is to begin to fill PFAS data gaps throughout the state to support the development of fish consumption thresholds and OEHHA advisory tissue levels (ATLs) for PFAS. State and Regional Water Boards Budgets will enabled analysis of close to 200 samples in 2024. Prioritize the analysis of additional archiveswhen budget permits as well as the development of a data report that summarizes and interprets the results of PFAS Archive data.\nAction 5.2: PFAS Monitoring Feasability - Once PFAS archive results and interpretation are synthesized, review and discuss the need for and feasibility of including consistent and robust PFAS monitoring into regular statewide monitoring plans.\n\n\n4.2.2 Project 6: Explore the feasibility of developing and implementing a statewide consumption survey\nThe 2024 Long-term Monitoring Priorities Assessment Process confirmed and quantified the need for a consistent, robust, and statewide consumption survey (or surveys). Of the nine Regional Water Boards and one State Board Division (DWQ) that provided feedback during the process, 90% of respondents (9/10) identified the need to have information on consumption patterns to better inform their work.\nA number of Regions also discussed efforts they have underway to develop or implement local or regional consumption surveys. The ultimate goal of the below activities is to learn from and build on existing consumption survey efforts, and make a plan to coordinate and leverage resources to implement a robust, statewide fish consumption survey (or surveys) to understand consumption locations, fishing intensity, target species, methods, and concerns of consumers at water bodies throughout the state.\nAction 6.1: Synthesize lessons from recent consumption survey efforts - A number of consumption surveys have been conducted at California water bodies (see the California Fish Consumption Study Inventory. More recently (2022-2024):\n\nThe San Francisco Regional Water Board (Region 2) has been working with Community Based Organizations (CBOs) in the region to develop a San Francisco Bay consumption survey questionnaire\nThe Los Angeles Regional Water Board (Region 4) has been conducting a subsistence fishing survey for a select number of freshwater bodies in the Region\n\nOne the Region 2 and Region 4 efforts have been completed, review methods and results in the context of more historical surveys, discuss with Regional Board SWAMP Coordinators (and/or survey leads) and synthesize methods, costs, lessons, and anything else that might be helpful.\nAction 6.2: Identify resources and partners needed for robust and comprehensive implementation of a statewide consumption survey - Present synthesis results (Action 5.1) to SWAMP Mangement, the STEW, and others as appropriate (e.g. DWQ, OEHHA, CDFW) to explore the feasibility of developing and implementing a statewide fish consumption survey, and to identify resources and partners needed for comprehensive implementation.",

    "text": "5.2 Partner Network\nBelow is a visual representation of the partners currently in our network as well as descriptions of and links to partner websites.\n\n\n\nNetwork map of STEW and Program partners\n\n\n\n5.2.1 SWAMP Bioaccumulation Monitoring Program Contractors\nMoss Landing Marine Laboratories’ (MLML) Marine Pollution Studies Laboratory (MPSL): Our MLML/MPSL partners lead the sample collection and processing efforts.\nSan Francisco Estuary Institute (SFEI): Our SFEI partners lead the data analysis, interpretation and reporting process, and help Co-chair the STEW!\n\n\n5.2.2 Other SWAMP Programs\nSWAMP Regional Monitoring Programs: Many Regional SWAMP Programs augment the efforts of the Statewide Bioaccumulation Monitoring Program, or conduct bioaccumulation related studies of their own to address regionally-specific water quality concerns.\nSWAMP Information Management and Quality Assurance Center (SWAMP IQ): SWAMP IQ conducts a thorough quality assurance review and verification of all of our data before adding the data to our public data systems.\nSWAMP Statewide Freshwater and Estuarine Harmful Algal Bloom (FHAB) Program: We’re working with the FHAB Program to better understand the nexus between harmful algal blooms and bioaccumulation risks.\nSWAMP eDNA Metabarcoding Monitoring and Analysis Project (SeMMAP): We’re beginning to work with SeMMAP to better understand the extent to which environmental DNA (eDNA) can be used to support our monitoring efforts. \n\n\n5.2.3 Other Monitoring Efforts\nWhenever possible, we try to collaborate with other bioaccumulation monitoring programs, including:\n\nRegional Monitoring Program for Water Quality in San Francisco Bay (Bay RMP)\nSouthern California Bight Regional Monitoring Program (Bight RMP)\nThe Delta Regional Monitoring Program (Delta RMP)\nMarine Biotoxin Monitoring Program\nUS EPA National Aquatic Resource Surveys\n\nThe National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA)\nThe National Lakes Assessment (NLA)\nThe National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA)\nThe National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA)\n\nBiomonitoring California\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Other California State Agencies\nWe work closely with other CA State Agencies to make sure our data is used to protect public health, and is communicated effectively in the public health space so that those that are most impacted by consuming contaminated fish and shellfish can make informed decisions to reduce their exposure to harmful pollutants in fish and shellfish.\n\nThe Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) is the lead state agency for the assessment of health risks posed by environmental contaminants. OEHHA uses our data to develop site specific and statewide fish advisories. \nThe California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is the state department responsible for public health in California. We’re building stronger relationships with some of their programs (e.g., Center for Healthy Communities) to more efficiently and effectively achieve our respective missions.\nThe California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) is the state department responsible for managing California’s fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and the habitats upon which they depend. We’re building stronger relationships with some of their programs (e.g., Regional monitoring experts, Fishing in the City) to more efficiently and effectively achieve our respective missions.\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Other State and Regional Water Board Programs\nThe State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) and the nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards (Regional Water Boards), collectively known as the California Water Boards (Water Boards) are dedicated to a single mission:\n\nTo preserve, enhance, and restore the quality of California’s water resources and drinking water for the protection of the environment, public health, and all beneficial uses, and to ensure proper water resource allocation and efficient use, for the benefit of present and future generations.\n\nUnder the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and the state’s pioneering Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, the State and Regional Water Boards have regulatory responsibility for protecting the water quality of nearly 1.6 million acres of lakes, 1.3 million acres of bays and estuaries, 211,000 miles of rivers and streams, and about 1,100 miles of exquisite California coastline! \nThere are a number of programs that partner with us and/or use our data to inform their work, including:\n\nTribal Affairs and their Tribal Beneficial Use efforts\nStatewide Mercury Control Program\nIntegrated Report Program\nTMDL Programs\nBacteria Objectives\nBiostimulation, Cyanotoxins, and Biological Condition Provisions\nOcean Standards Unit\nWetlands Program\nConstituents of Emerging Concern (CEC)\nPer- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)\n\nFor more details on how our data are used in some of these programs, see:\n\nHow are bioaccumulation data used to protect and restore water quality in CA?\nHow are bioaccumulation data used to protect human health in CA?\nGeneral bioaccumulation data use FAQs\n\n\n\n5.2.6 California Native American Tribes & Tribal Organizations\nCalifornia Indian Environmental Alliance (CIEA): We work closely with our CIEA partners on a number of bioaccumulation related projects. CIEA is also an active member of the STEW!\nWe’re working on building more relationships with California Native American Tribes through the Program’s equity initiatives. See the Tribal Engagement FAQ for more information on how tribes and tribal organizations can engage with the Program and/or the STEW.\n\n\n5.2.7 Other California Water Quality Monitoring Council Workgroups\nEquity Workgroup: STEW Co-chairs are actively involved with this Workgroup and its efforts to operationalize equity in all levels of the Council.\nWe’re working on building stronger partnerships with the following Workgroups:\n\nCalifornia Cyanobacteria and Harmful Algal Bloom (CCHAB) Network\nCalifornia Estuary Monitoring Workgroup\nCalifornia Water Quality Monitoring Collaboration Network\nCalifornia Wetland Monitoring Workgroup\nHealthy Watersheds Partnership\nCalifornia Ocean & Coastal Ecosystem Workgroup\n\n\n\n5.2.8 Academic Institutions\nWe’re working on building more relationships with the academic community so we can leverage our partnerships, advance needed research, and connect with emerging academics and future scientists and leaders of California! Partner academic institutions include:\n\nCSU-WATER (Water Advocacy for Education and Research)\n\nCSU Northridge Water Science Lab\n\nCSU COAST (Council on Ocean Affairs, Science & Technology)\n\nAre you at an academic institution conducting research related to bioaccumulation, fish advisory development, and/or statewide bioaccumulation monitoring efforts - but are not included in the list above? Please let us know by emailing the SWAMP Bioaccumulation Monitoring Program Coordinator & STEW Co-chair at Anna.Holder@waterboards.ca.gov!",
