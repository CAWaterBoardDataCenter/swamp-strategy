In addition to providing information and tools, SWAMP’s vision is to help enhance monitoring, assessment and reporting activities throughout the Water Boards.\nStatewide SWAMP Monitoring Programs include:",

OEHHA uses our data to develop site specific and statewide fish advisories. \nThe California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is the state department responsible for public health in California. We’re building stronger relationships with some of their programs (e.g., Center for Healthy Communities) to more efficiently and effectively achieve our respective missions.\nThe California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) is the state department responsible for managing California’s fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and the habitats upon which they depend. We’re building stronger relationships with some of their programs (e.g., Regional monitoring experts, Fishing in the City) to more efficiently and effectively achieve our respective missions.\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Other State and Regional Water Board Programs\nThe State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) and the nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards (Regional Water Boards), collectively known as the California Water Boards (Water Boards) are dedicated to a single mission:\n\nTo preserve, enhance, and restore the quality of California’s water resources and drinking water for the protection of the environment, public health, and all beneficial uses, and to ensure proper water resource allocation and efficient use, for the benefit of present and future generations.\n\nUnder the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and the state’s pioneering Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, the State and Regional Water Boards have regulatory responsibility for protecting the water quality of nearly 1.6 million acres of lakes, 1.3 million acres of bays and estuaries, 211,000 miles of rivers and streams, and about 1,100 miles of exquisite California coastline! \nThere are a number of programs that partner with us and/or use our data to inform their work, including:\n\nTribal Affairs and their Tribal Beneficial Use efforts\nStatewide Mercury Control Program\nIntegrated Report Program\nTMDL Programs\nBacteria Objectives\nBiostimulation, Cyanotoxins, and Biological Condition Provisions\nOcean Standards Unit\nWetlands Program\nConstituents of Emerging Concern (CEC)\nPer- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)\n\nFor more details on how our data are used in some of these programs, see:\n\nHow are bioaccumulation data used to protect and restore water quality in CA?\nHow are bioaccumulation data used to protect human health in CA?\nGeneral bioaccumulation data use FAQs\n\n\n\n5.2.6 California Native American Tribes & Tribal Organizations\nCalifornia Indian Environmental Alliance (CIEA): We work closely with our CIEA partners on a number of bioaccumulation related projects. CIEA is also an active member of the STEW!\nWe’re working on building more relationships with California Native American Tribes through the Program’s equity initiatives. See the Tribal Engagement FAQ for more information on how tribes and tribal organizations can engage with the Program and/or the STEW.\n\n\n5.2.7 Other California Water Quality Monitoring Council Workgroups\nEquity Workgroup: STEW Co-chairs are actively involved with this Workgroup and its efforts to operationalize equity in all levels of the Council.\nWe’re working on building stronger partnerships with the following Workgroups:\n\nCalifornia Cyanobacteria and Harmful Algal Bloom (CCHAB) Network\nCalifornia Estuary Monitoring Workgroup\nCalifornia Water Quality Monitoring Collaboration Network\nCalifornia Wetland Monitoring Workgroup\nHealthy Watersheds Partnership\nCalifornia Ocean & Coastal Ecosystem Workgroup\n\n\n\n5.2.8 Academic Institutions\nWe’re working on building more relationships with the academic community so we can leverage our partnerships, advance needed research, and connect with emerging academics and future scientists and leaders of California! Partner academic institutions include:\n\nCSU-WATER (Water Advocacy for Education and Research)\n\nCSU Northridge Water Science Lab\n\nCSU COAST (Council on Ocean Affairs, Science & Technology)\n\nAre you at an academic institution conducting research related to bioaccumulation, fish advisory development, and/or statewide bioaccumulation monitoring efforts - but are not included in the list above?
